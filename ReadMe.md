## Project Overview

Item response Theory as a Latent variable Model is dominantly being used in development of static as well as computer Adaptive test assessment. This project aims to develop a mathematics test assessment using Item Response Theory (IRT). The data used in this project has not been taken from real world but has bene simulated using programming code. The focus is on simulating responses, calibrating items and to produce a final ready to use test assessment.

### Purpose

The primary purpose of this project is to:

* Demonstrate the process of **simulating test response data**.
* Apply the **3-Parameter Logistic (3PL) IRT model** for item calibration and ability estimation.
* Explore **psychometric properties** such as reliability, item discrimination, difficulty, and guessing.


### Methodology

1. **Data Simulation**:

   * A synthetic dataset is generated programmatically, representing responses of multiple examinees to a set of test items.
   * Each item includes parameters for difficulty, discrimination, and guessing, aligned with the 3PL model.

2. **Reliability & Factor Analysis**:

   * The project evaluates the **internal consistency** of the test using metrics like Cronbachâ€™s alpha and omega reliability.
   * Factor analysis, including **Schmid-Leiman decomposition**, is performed to understand the contribution of general and group factors.

3. **Item Calibration**:

   * Using the 3PL model, **item parameters** are estimated to determine how well each question discriminates between examinees of different ability levels.

4. **Visualization & Interpretation**:

   * Key results, such as item characteristic curves, ability distributions, and reliability plots, are visualized for easier interpretation.

### Key Notes

* **Simulated Data Only**: The data used in this project is entirely synthetic and **does not reflect real-world responses**.
* **Focus on 3PL Model**: The project demonstrates the practical application of the 3-Parameter Logistic IRT model.
* **Reproducibility**: All steps, from data generation to analysis, are fully reproducible using the provided scripts.

### Outcome

By following this workflow, users can:

* Understand how to generate and work with IRT data.
* Apply 3PL calibration to assess item quality and examinee abilities.
* Explore reliability, factor structure, and other psychometric properties for a test.
